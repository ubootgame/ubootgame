# Building in Public

It's a game we've dreamed about for years now. We never started development, but that changes today. At this stage, it's not much more than a few loosely related thoughts, ideas and experiments we want to run. There is a million things to learn, such as [Golang](https://go.dev/), [Ebitenengine](https://ebitengine.org/), game design, sound design, music, graphics, [aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), [entity component system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system), artificial intelligence.

This blog will be used to document our journey, the things we learn along the way, and the progress the game is making. We'll be building in public, to keep us on our toes.

# The Game

In the game the player will pilot a destroy-class ship, with a unique, challenging control-scheme. Fights will take place in the air and with submerged enemies. You can expect updates as we refine our thinking around the game, its design and gameplay loop.

# The Latest

We publish every build at the following url, fully playable in your browser thanks to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/)!
